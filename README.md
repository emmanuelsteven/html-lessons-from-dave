This is a 4hour intense course on HTML5 
 at lesson 6 images were uploaded to the index.html file created 
images are inserted with the image tag <img> with had several atrributes like 
src- which sources out the image from it's location 
alt- this reads out the image name for emphasis 
title - this puts a title on the image which is only seen when  you hover around it.
width and height-we provide these atrributes  still even though css would can still overwrite it because of cummulative layout shift;we provide this information to tell the browser this image  is going to take some space here and this is how much.
